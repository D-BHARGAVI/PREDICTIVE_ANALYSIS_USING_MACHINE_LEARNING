TASK:2 
-> Task Objective
In this task, I built a simple machine learning model to classify flower species using the Iris dataset. 
The goal was to train a model that can predict the type of flower based on its features.

-> Tools Used
- Google Colab
- Python
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)

-> Dataset
I used the Iris dataset from sklearn. It includes 150 samples of flowers with 4 features:
- sepal length
- sepal width
- petal length
- petal width  
The target is to predict the flower type: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

-> Steps I Followed
- Loaded the dataset using sklearn
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Trained a logistic regression model
- Evaluated the model accuracy and printed the classification report

-> Key Insights
- The model predicted the flower species with good accuracy
- Logistic regression worked well for this classification problem

-> Conclusion 
I learned how to train and test a classification model using Python and scikit-learn.
